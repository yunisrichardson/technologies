# How Simple IT Solutions Save Big Office Problems: GlobalLogic Engineer's Column

## Smart Parking

Do you face the situation when you have a meeting in 5 minutes and you're still looking for a parking space? Business center parking lots are often overcrowded, and spaces need to be taken in advance, like lounge chairs at the beach.

Stuffy offices, crowded parking lots and busy meeting rooms are a familiar story not only for large corporations but for smaller companies as well. But many of these problems can be solved with the help of fairly simple engineering developments, says Alexey Oguy, Senior Manager and Engineer at GlobalLogic.
To minimize conflicts for free spaces, the engineers in Kharkiv have come up with Parking Logic. This system is still being tested, but we can already say that it will facilitate and speed up the parking process. With the help of the development, you can see in real time the status of parking spaces in the business center parking in mobile and web applications and find a free parking space.

This means our specialists will not have to drive extra laps around the parking lot, but will be able to assess the situation beforehand and decide whether to enter the parking lot or leave the car somewhere nearby. This way we save nerves and time on unnecessary maneuvers.

### The negotiation booking system
Another example is meeting rooms. Surely many are familiar with the signs for reservations, from which it is not particularly clear whether the room is free until you go in. Not only that, but if your office is not an open space, but a cubicle system, the meeting is periodically interrupted by people walking in to find an empty meeting room.

Of course, to solve this, you can get everyone to follow the signage and remember to clean up meetings if they are cancelled or rescheduled. In our Lviv office, we also faced this problem and realized that it was easier and more efficient to make a Meeting Room Calendar app. In fact, it is an online calendar of meeting room bookings, which is tied to the office email and calendar.

In addition, next to the meeting, the screen automatically shows the status of the meeting, who occupied it and for how long. You can also use this screen to report equipment breakdowns. After that the application automatically generates a request to the departments that can fix the situation. Thus, work processes are optimized - no need to search for the person in charge all over the office and waste time, you just need to leave a request.

The less distractions in the office, the more his tasks will be covered by the specialist. He won't have to waste his time fighting with the cooler for the last drop of water while the office is stuffy and hot.

If you want to repeat our experience, then I advise you first assess whether it suits you. For example, if you have a small office, a "free/busy" sign might solve your intercom problem much better than creating a separate program.

How often have you encountered someone who is cold in the office and turns on the air conditioner to heat, and someone else who is stuffy and asks you to open a window? It is a typical problem, isn't it? Not all office buildings have central air conditioning systems nowadays.
